          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young<br />
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
          at<br />
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing<br />
          far beyond the world of known physics. He was trying to understand
          why<br />
          there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been<br />
          created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made<br />
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the presumed<br />
          course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a<br />
          special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe
          to<br />
          swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent<br />
          instant. If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like
          why<br />
          the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged,<br />
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the
          wrinkles<br />
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be<br />
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. “SPECTACULAR<br />
          REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a<br />
          double box around it.On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in.
          RadioOn<br />
          Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that<br />
          they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis,<br />
          known undramatically as inflation, looked right. Reaching back
          across<br />
          13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with
          telescopes<br />
          at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of
          the<br />
          Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the<br />
          fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the
          signature<br />
          of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a<br />
          trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They
          are<br />
          the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac<br />
          and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct. Inflation has
          been<br />
          the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr.<br />
          Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved. If corroborated,
          Dr.<br />
          Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the<br />
          recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of
          the<br />
          Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and<br />
          energy to science and speculation. Confirming inflation would mean<br />
          that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space<br />
          with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal<br />
          patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are<br />
          unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an<br />
          endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity,
          like<br />
          a pot of pasta water boiling over. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading

          “With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have
          been<br />
          lucky.” The results are the closely guarded distillation of three<br />
          years’ worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear
          of<br />
          a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a
          select<br />
          few, meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts<br />
          Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping
          that<br />
          night in 1979), in his office last week. “It was a very special<br />
          moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr.
          Kovac,<br />
          who chose his words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.<br />
          Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described
          the<br />
          most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in<br />
          1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when<br />
          Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s
          team,<br />
          knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell him the
          news.<br />

          Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had
          ordered<br />
          anything. “And then I told him that in the beginning we thought
          that<br />
          this was a delivery but we did not think that we ordered anything,
          but<br />
          I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr.
          Linde<br />
          wrote in an email. Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean
          island,<br />
          Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news like
          this<br />
          is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said. By last weekend,
          as<br />
          social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen
          and<br />
          news spread, astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation<br />
          and caution. ADVERTISEMENT Continue reading the main story Max<br />
          Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that
          if<br />
          this stays true, it will go down as one of the greatest discoveries
          in<br />
          the history of science.” John E. Carlstrom of the University of<br />
          Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project called
          the<br />
          South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think<br />
          the results are beautiful and very convincing,” he said. Paul J.<br />
          Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that<br />
          posits the clash of a pair of universes as the cause of genesis,
          said<br />
          that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he<br />
          expressed reservations about inflation. Lawrence M. Krauss of
          Arizona<br />
          State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting<br />
          that the new results exceeded earlier estimates based on
          temperature<br />
          maps of the cosmic background by the European Space Agency’s Planck<br />
          satellite and other assumptions about the universe. “So we will
          need<br />
          to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.<br />
          Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft
          will<br />
          report its own findings this year. At least a dozen other teams are<br />
          trying similar measurements from balloons, mountaintops and space.<br />
          Spirals in the Sky Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret
          yet<br />
          pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were discovered
          accidentally<br />
          by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They
          won<br />
          the Nobel Prize. Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the<br />
          secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which
          has<br />
          operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the<br />
          South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing<br />
          conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of<br />
          Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and<br />
          Dr. Kuo of Stanford.

        <p>
          In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave<br>
          radiation was polarized, meaning the light waves had a slight<br>
          preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another. This was a<br>
          step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves<br>
          from inflation. Such waves, squeezing space in one direction and<br>
          stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the direction of<br>
          polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of<br>
          the polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in<br>
          spirals. Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally<br>
          small differences in the temperature of the microwaves. The group’s<br>
          telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.<br>
          “We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said. The<br>
          strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a<br>
          year burning up time on a Harvard supercomputer, making sure they had<br>
          things right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the<br>
          breakthrough. A Special Time The data traced the onset of inflation to<br>
          a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his Palo Alto<br>
          house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the<br>
          evolution of the universe. Continue reading the main<br>
          story Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today:<br>
          gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and weak nuclear forces. But<br>
          they have long suspected that those are simply different<br>
          manifestations of a single unified force that ruled the universe in<br>
          its earliest, hottest moments. As the universe cooled, according to<br>
          this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk mythology<br>
          of gods or brothers falling out with each other. The laws of physics<br>
          evolved, with one force after another splitting away. That was where<br>
          Dr. Guth came in. Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay<br>
          liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees, until it is<br>
          disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent<br>
          heat. Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified<br>
          state too long. In that case, space itself would become imbued with a<br>
          mysterious latent energy. Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the<br>
          latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the universe<br>
          would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the<br>
          repulsive force, the more space was created, the harder it pushed<br>
          apart. What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at<br>
          least a trillion trillionfold — from a submicroscopic speck of<br>
          primordial energy to the size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic<br><br>
          eye-blink. Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into<br>
          ordinary particles and radiation. All of normal cosmic history was<br>
          still ahead, resulting in today’s observable universe, a patch of sky<br>
          and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said that there<br>
          is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the<br>
          universe might be the ultimate free lunch.”<br>
